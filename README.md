## Program
I created this program in Maple, a programming language originating from the University of Waterloo. Maple was created with the purpose of solving complex mathematical equations. It has cool features such as drawing colourful fractal equations.

## Description

The Game of Life is a program developed by Mathematician John Conway. It consists of a two dimensional grid of square cells, with each being in one of two possible states, dead (0) or alive (1). The state of these cells is determined by the states of the cells adjacent to it:

• Any live cell with less than two live cells around it dies from under population.
• Any live cell with over three live cells around it dies from over population.
• Any live cell with either two or three live cells around it lives on to the next
generation.
• Any dead cell with exactly three live cells around it becomes a living cell,
imitating birth.

The first generation of the grid is created by assigning a specified number of cells to random points on the grid. The following generations are then created by using these rules.

## Why its cool

Conway’s Game of Life is one of the simplest examples of what is called “self organizing systems”. It is a subject area that has captured the attention of scientists and mathematicians of diverse fields. It is the study of how elaborate patterns and behaviors can emerge from very simple rules. It can help to understand the diversity of life that has evolved on Earth.
